Snake Game

Spec: [https://cs61c.org/sp22/projects/proj1/](https://cs61c.org/sp22/projects/proj1/)

This project was a great introduction and refresher on pointers and C syntax in general.

Make sure you have all dependencies installed (make, gcc).
Then, run "make snake" and then "make interactive-snake" (Note: This only works on Linux-style systems, sorry Windows users!)
